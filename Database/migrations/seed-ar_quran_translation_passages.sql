In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy 1 Glory to Him who made His servant travel by night from the sacred place of worship to the furthest place of worship, whose surroundings We have blessed, to show him some of Our signs: He alone is the All Hearing, the All Seeing. 2 We also gave Moses the Scripture, and made it a guide for the Children of Israel. ‘Entrust yourselves to no one but Me, 3 you descendants of those We carried with Noah: he was truly a thankful servant.’ 4 We declared to the Children of Israel in the Scripture, ‘Twice you will spread corruption in the land and become highly arrogant.’ 5 When the fi rst of these warnings was ful fi lled, We sent against you servants of Ours with great force, and they ravaged your homes. That warning was ful fi lled, 6 but then We allowed you to prevail against your enemy. We increased your wealth and o ff spring and made you more numerous–– 7 whether you do good or evil it is to your own souls––and when the second warning was ful fi lled [We sent them] to shame your faces and enter the place of worship as they did the fi rst time, and utterly destroy whatever fell into their power. 8 Your Lord may yet have mercy on you, but if you do the same again, so shall We: We have made Hell a prison for those who defy [Our warning]."}');

The disbelievers of Mecca are warned through a description of the punishment that awaits them on the Day of Resurrection. Two references are made to their accusing the Prophet of madness (verses 8 and 46 ) and this charge is thoroughly refuted. In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy 1 Praise be to God, to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and earth, and praise be to Him in the life to come. He is the All Wise, the All Aware. 2 He knows all that goes into the earth and all that comes out of it; He knows all that comes down from the heavens and all that goes up to them. He is the Merciful, the Forgiving. 3 Still, the disbelievers say, ‘The Last Hour will never come upon us.’ Say, ‘Yes, by my Lord, [it will], by Him who knows the unseen! Not even the weight of a speck of dust in the heavens or earth escapes His knowledge, nor anything smaller or greater. It is all recorded in a clear Record 4 so that He can reward those who believe and do good deeds: they will have forgiveness and generous provision.’ 5 But as for those who work against Our Revelations, seeking to undermine them, there will be a torment of painful su ff ering. 6 [Prophet], those who have been given knowledge can see that what has been sent to you from your Lord is the truth, and that it leads to the path of the Almighty, worthy of all praise. 7 But the disbelievers say, ‘Shall we show you a man who claims that, when you have been utterly torn to pieces, you will be raised in a new creation? 8 Has he invented a lie about God? Is he mad?’ No! It is those who do not believe in the life to come who will su ff er torment, for they are in gross error. 9 Do they not think about what is in front of them and behind them in the heavens and earth?

God is well informed about His servants, He sees everything. 32 We gave the Scripture as a heritage to Our chosen servants: some of them wronged their own souls, some stayed between [right and wrong], and some, by God’s leave, were foremost in good deeds. That is the greatest favour: 33 they will enter lasting Gardens where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, where they will wear silk garments. 34 They will say, ‘Praise be to God, who has separated us from all sorrow! Our Lord is truly most forgiving, most appreciative: 35 He has, in His bounty, settled us in the everlasting Home where no toil or fatigue will touch us.’ 36 But those who reject the truth will stay in Hell fi re, where they will neither be fi nished o ff by death, nor be relieved from Hell’s torment: this is how We reward hardened disbelievers. 37 They will cry out loud in Hell, ‘Lord, let us out, and we will do righteous deeds, not what we did before!’– –‘ Did We not give you a life long enough to take warning if you were going to? The warner came to you, now taste the punishment.’ The evildoers will have nobody to help them. 38 God knows all that is hidden in the heavens and earth; He knows the thoughts contained in the heart; 39 it is He who made you [people] successors to the land. Those who deny the truth will bear the consequences: their denial will only make them more odious to their Lord, and add only to their loss. 40 Say, ‘Consider those “partners” of yours that you call upon beside God. Show me! What part of the earth did they create? What share of the heavens do they possess?’ Have We given them a book that contains clear evidence? No indeed! The idolaters promise each other only delusion. 41 God keeps the heavens and earth from vanishing; if they did vanish, no one else could stop them.

If they deny God and His revelations, what message will they believe in? 7 Woe to every lying sinful person 8 who hears God’s revelations being recited to him, yet persists in his arrogance as if he had never heard them––[Prophet] bring him news of a painful torment!–– 9 who, if he knows anything about Our revelations, ridicules it! Such people will have a humiliating torment: 10 Hell lurks behind them and their gains will not bene fi t them, nor will those beings they took as protectors beside God––a tremendous torment awaits them. 11 This is true guidance; those who reject their Lord’s revelations will have a woeful torment. 12 It is God who subjected the sea for you––ships sail on it by His command so that you can seek His bounty and give Him thanks–– 13 He has subjected all that is in the heavens and the earth for your bene fi t, as a gift from Him.
